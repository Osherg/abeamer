# Description

When contributing to the open-source community, developers many times end up being
in the receiving end of everyone who _forgot the put garbage in the bin before leaving home_.  
  
To keep an healthy developing environment, it's stickily banned:  

- B01. All forms of harassment.   
- B02. Abusive language.   
- B02. Comments that undervalue other's people work or character.   
- B03. Inflated ego comments.   
- B04. Confined space solutions, alas any comment that is only applied to a certain region,
status quo, wealth or human language.   

  
Anyone who transgress these rules, risks itself of having is post or work removed 
and banned from future interactions.

## Reporting bugs

To prevent any kind of friction with the developers, keep it simple and use following template:
'
Under these circumstances. 
 <Version/OS/etc...>
 
This issue occurs: 
<Describe the issue>
'
Reporting problems without defining the circumstances can lead to a long process 
of discovering which will delay the solution.
